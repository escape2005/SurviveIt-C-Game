# Game-using-C-Language
The Repository will be for Game made using C Language.
Hello everyone, Yogesh here.
This is our Github Repository for creating a game using C Language.
It will be very fun creating a whole new game which can function efficiently with less complexity.
I have researched for some simple but fun games which can be coded by C language.
These are:
1. Guess the Number: Create a game where the computer generates a random number, and the player has to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
2. Tic-Tac-Toe: Implement a two-player tic-tac-toe game. Allow players to take turns and check for a win or a draw.
3. Hangman: Create a word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it letter by letter while keeping track of incorrect guesses.
4. Snake: Implement a simple version of the classic Snake game. The player controls a snake that grows longer as it consumes food.
5. Pong: Create a basic Pong game where two players control paddles and try to bounce a ball past their opponent.
6. Memory(Match the Cards): Design a game where the player has to match pairs of cards by turning them over two at a time.
7. Trivia: Create a text-based quiz game where the player answers questions on various topics and earns points.
